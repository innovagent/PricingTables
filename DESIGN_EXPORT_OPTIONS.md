# Design Export Options for Your Pricing Table

Unfortunately, there's no direct way to export a functional React component back to a Figma design file (.fig). The typical workflow is:

**Figma Design â†’ Figma Make â†’ Web Application**

However, here are several alternatives to preserve and share your design work:

## Option 1: Design Documentation Package

Create a comprehensive design documentation that can be referenced in Figma:

### Design Specifications

```yaml
# Pricing Table Design System
Colors:
  Primary Background: "#6d28d9"
  Card Background: "linear-gradient(145deg, #3a1a8a, #2a1270)"
  Text Primary: "#f4f4f4"
  Text Secondary: "#f4f4f4" (80% opacity)
  Accent Orange: "#ff5722"
  Success Green: "#10b981"
  Error Red: "#ef4444"

Typography:
  Font Family: "Raleway"
  Heading 1: 60px, Bold, White
  Heading 2: 24px, Bold, #f4f4f4
  Price Display: 60px, Bold, #f4f4f4
  Body Text: 16px, Medium, #f4f4f4 (90% opacity)
  Button Text: 18px, Semibold, White

Spacing:
  Container Padding: 96px (top/bottom), 24px (sides)
  Card Gap: 32px
  Internal Padding: 32px
  Button Height: 56px

Effects:
  Card Shadow: "0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)"
  Popular Card Ring: "3px solid #ff5722"
  Button Hover: "translateY(-3px) scale(1.02)"
```

## Option 2: Static Design Export

Export your pricing table as high-fidelity images for reference:

### Screenshot Package
- Full pricing table view (desktop)
- Mobile responsive view
- Individual card designs
- Hover state demonstrations
- Color palette swatches

## Option 3: Figma Plugin Integration

Create a Figma plugin that displays your live pricing table:

```typescript
// Figma Plugin Concept
// This would display your deployed pricing table in an iframe within Figma

figma.showUI(__html__, {
  width: 1200,
  height: 800
});

// Embed your deployed pricing table
const iframe = `
<iframe 
  src="https://your-pricing-table.vercel.app" 
  width="100%" 
  height="100%" 
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
`;
```

## Option 4: Design Token Export

Export your design as design tokens that can be imported into design systems:

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "pricing": {
      "background": {
        "value": "#6d28d9",
        "type": "color"
      },
      "card": {
        "value": "linear-gradient(145deg, #3a1a8a, #2a1270)",
        "type": "color"
      }
    }
  },
  "typography": {
    "pricing": {
      "heading": {
        "value": {
          "fontFamily": "Raleway",
          "fontWeight": 700,
          "fontSize": "60px",
          "lineHeight": 1.2
        },
        "type": "typography"
      }
    }
  },
  "effects": {
    "pricing": {
      "cardShadow": {
        "value": {
          "type": "dropShadow",
          "color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)",
          "x": 0,
          "y": 25,
          "blur": 50,
          "spread": -12
        },
        "type": "effect"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 5: Component Library Documentation

Create a comprehensive component library that designers can reference:

### Component Anatomy
1. **Container**: Full-width background with purple gradient
2. **Header Section**: Title, subtitle, billing toggle
3. **Card Grid**: 3-column responsive grid
4. **Pricing Cards**: Individual tier components
5. **Feature Lists**: Checkmark/X icon + text
6. **CTA Buttons**: Gradient buttons with hover effects

### Interaction States
- **Default**: Static display
- **Hover**: Card lift, button scale
- **Toggle**: Annual/Monthly price switching
- **Mobile**: Stack to single column

## Option 6: Live Reference Integration

Since you have a deployed version, you can reference it directly in your design workflow:

### Reference Methods
1. **Browser Tab**: Keep your deployed pricing table open as reference
2. **Design Specs**: Use browser dev tools to inspect exact measurements
3. **Color Picker**: Use design tools to sample colors from the live version
4. **Responsive Testing**: Test different viewport sizes

## Option 7: Recreation Guide

If you need to recreate this in Figma Design, here's a step-by-step approach:

### Recreation Steps
1. **Create Artboards**: Desktop (1200px+) and Mobile (375px)
2. **Background**: Apply purple gradient background
3. **Typography**: Import Raleway font family
4. **Card Components**: Create master component for pricing cards
5. **Feature Lists**: Create component for feature rows
6. **Buttons**: Create button component with gradient fills
7. **Responsive Variants**: Create mobile variants

## Recommended Approach

**Best Practice**: Use your deployed pricing table as a living style guide while working in Figma Design. This ensures:

- âœ… Accurate measurements and spacing
- âœ… Correct color values
- âœ… Proper typography scale
- âœ… Real interaction behavior reference
- âœ… Responsive design validation

## Tools for Design Transfer

### Color Extraction
- **ColorZilla** (Chrome extension)
- **Sip** (macOS color picker)
- **Adobe Color** (web-based)

### Measurement Tools
- **PixelSnap** (macOS screen ruler)
- **MeasureIt** (Firefox extension)
- **Browser DevTools** (built-in inspection)

### Font Detection
- **WhatFont** (browser extension)
- **Font Face Ninja** (Chrome extension)

---

**Bottom Line**: While you can't directly export to .h2d format, your functional pricing table serves as the ultimate design reference. Use it as a living style guide for any future design work! ðŸŽ¨
